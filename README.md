Digibrawl
========================================================================

Digibrawl is a web game for Digimon battles. It's a mix of the existing games and new mechanics.

This repository contains the files needed to set up your own Digibrawl server. Note that to set up a server, you'll also need a server computer.

You can use your own computer as a server, but for other people to connect to your computer, you'll need to expose a port (default is 8000 but you can choose a different one) to connect to, by setting up any firewalls you might have to allow that port through to you (this sometimes isn't possible on certain internet connections).

This application is based in [Pok√©mon Showdown][1].
